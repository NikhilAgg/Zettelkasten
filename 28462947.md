# OpenGL shader objects
Shader objects are objects which are used to manage and check the source code for our shaders. To create a shader object using the function `glCreateShader`. This function takes in 1 arguements:
1. The shader type e.g GL_VERTEX_SHADER for a vertex shader
The function returns an unsigned int which will be as reference/id for the shader.

You can then add the shader source code to the object using the function `glShaderSource`. This function takes in two arguements:
1. The id of the shader object
2. A String that contains the source code.
Since the function requires the source code as a string you will need to load the shader file into C++ using fstream and covert the text into a string.

Finally after you add the source code you need to compile the shader. Compiling the shader checks the source code for any errors and other checks. To compile a shader object use the function `glCompileShader` which takes in 1 arguement:
1. The id of the shader object
