# OpenGL program objects
A program object is an object to which <28462947> can be attached. They are then converted into executable files after they have been linked and so can be used by the GPU. A program object can be created using the function `glCreateProgram`. It has no arguements but returns an unsigned int which will be used as the id for the program. 

You can then add shaders to a program object by using the function `glAttachShader` which has two arguments:
1. The id of the program object
2. The id of the shader object

Then you need to link the program to create the executable. This can be done with the function `glLinkProgram`. You should also run the function `glValidateProgram` afterwards to check the executable is okay.

After the program has been linked you should detach the shader using the function `glDetachShader`. It has 1 argument:
1. The id of the shader object
This function deletes the source code of the shader from memory freeing up space.

You can switch between different programs using the function `glUseProgram(program_id)`
